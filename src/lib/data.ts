  // Note on Client-Side Encryption:
  // In a real-world scenario, the `password` and `notes` fields would be encrypted on the client
  // before being sent to the server for storage. Libraries like `crypto-js` or the browser's
  // built-in `SubtleCrypto` API are excellent choices for this. A master password, known only to the user,
  // would be used to derive an encryption key. This ensures that even if the database is
  // compromised, the user's sensitive data remains secure and unreadable.
